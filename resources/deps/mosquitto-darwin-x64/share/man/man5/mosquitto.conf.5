.SH "NAME"
mosquitto.conf \- the configuration file for mosquitto
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBmosquitto\&.conf\fR\ 'u
\fBmosquitto\&.conf\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmosquitto\&.conf\fR
is the configuration file for mosquitto\&. This file can reside anywhere as long as mosquitto can read it\&. By default, mosquitto does not need a configuration file and will use the default values listed below\&. See
\fBmosquitto\fR(8)
for information on how to load a configuration file\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
All lines with a # as the very first character are treated as a comment\&.
.PP
Configuration lines start with a variable name\&. The variable value is separated from the name by a single space\&.
.SH "AUTHENTICATION"
.PP
The authentication options described below allow a wide range of possibilities in conjunction with the listener options\&. This section aims to clarify the possibilities\&.
.PP
The simplest option is to have no authentication at all\&. This is the default if no other options are given\&. Unauthenticated encrypted support is provided by using the certificate based SSL/TLS based options cafile/capath, certfile and keyfile\&.
.PP
MQTT provides username/password authentication as part of the protocol\&. Use the password_file option to define the valid usernames and passwords\&. Be sure to use network encryption if you are using this option otherwise the username and password will be vulnerable to interception\&. Use the
\fBper_listener_settings\fR
to control whether passwords are required globally or on a per\-listener basis\&.
.PP
When using certificate based encryption there are three options that affect authentication\&. The first is require_certificate, which may be set to true or false\&. If false, the SSL/TLS component of the client will verify the server but there is no requirement for the client to provide anything for the server: authentication is limited to the MQTT built in username/password\&. If require_certificate is true, the client must provide a valid certificate in order to connect successfully\&. In this case, the second and third options, use_identity_as_username and use_subject_as_username, become relevant\&. If set to true, use_identity_as_username causes the Common Name (CN) from the client certificate to be used instead of the MQTT username for access control purposes\&. The password is not used because it is assumed that only authenticated clients have valid certificates\&. This means that any CA certificates you include in cafile or capath will be able to issue client certificates that are valid for connecting to your broker\&. If use_identity_as_username is false, the client must authenticate as normal (if required by password_file) through the MQTT options\&. The same principle applies for the use_subject_as_username option, but the entire certificate subject is used as the username instead of just the CN\&.
.PP
When using pre\-shared\-key based encryption through the psk_hint and psk_file options, the client must provide a valid identity and key in order to connect to the broker before any MQTT communication takes place\&. If use_identity_as_username is true, the PSK identity is used instead of the MQTT username for access control purposes\&. If use_identity_as_username is false, the client may still authenticate using the MQTT username/password if using the password_file option\&.
.PP
Both certificate and PSK based encryption are configured on a per\-listener basis\&.
.PP
Authentication plugins can be created to augment the password_file, acl_file and psk_file options with e\&.g\&. SQL based lookups\&.
.PP
It is possible to support multiple authentication schemes at once\&. A config could be created that had a listener for all of the different encryption options described above and hence a large number of ways of authenticating\&.
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBacl_file\fR \fIfile path\fR
.RS 4
Set the path to an access control list file\&. If defined, the contents of the file are used to control client access to topics on the broker\&.
.sp
If this parameter is defined then only the topics listed will have access\&. Topic access is added with lines of the format:
.sp
topic [read|write|readwrite] <topic>
.sp
The access type is controlled using "read", "write" or "readwrite"\&. This parameter is optional (unless <topic> includes a space character) \- if not given then the access is read/write\&. <topic> can contain the + or # wildcards as in subscriptions\&.
.sp
The first set of topics are applied to anonymous clients, assuming
\fBallow_anonymous\fR
is true\&. User specific topic ACLs are added after a user line as follows:
.sp
user <username>
.sp
The username referred to here is the same as in
\fBpassword_file\fR\&. It is not the clientid\&.
.sp
It is also possible to define ACLs based on pattern substitution within the topic\&. The form is the same as for the topic keyword, but using pattern as the keyword\&.
.sp
pattern [read|write|readwrite] <topic>
.sp
The patterns available for substition are:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
%c to match the client id of the client
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
%u to match the username of the client
.RE
.sp
The substitution pattern must be the only text for that level of hierarchy\&. Pattern ACLs apply to all users even if the "user" keyword has previously been given\&.
.sp
Example:
.sp
pattern write sensor/%u/data
.sp
Allow access for bridge connection messages:
.sp
pattern write $SYS/broker/connection/%c/state
.sp
If the first character of a line of the ACL file is a # it is treated as a comment\&.
.sp
If
\fBper_listener_settings\fR
is
\fItrue\fR, this option applies to the current listener being configured only\&. If
\fBper_listener_settings\fR
is
\fIfalse\fR, this option applies to all listeners\&.
.sp
Reloaded on reload signal\&. The currently loaded ACLs will be freed and reloaded\&. Existing subscriptions will be affected after the reload\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBallow_anonymous\fR [ true | false ]
.RS 4
Boolean value that determines whether clients that connect without providing a username are allowed to connect\&. If set to
\fIfalse\fR
then another means of connection should be created to control authenticated client access\&.
.sp
Defaults to
\fItrue\fR
if no other security options are set\&. If
\fBpassword_file\fR
or
\fBpsk_file\fR
is set, or if an authentication plugin is loaded which implements username/password or TLS\-PSK checks, then
\fBallow_anonymous\fR
defaults to
\fIfalse\fR\&.
.sp
If
\fBper_listener_settings\fR
is
\fItrue\fR, this option applies to the current listener being configured only\&. If
\fBper_listener_settings\fR
is
\fIfalse\fR, this option applies to all listeners\&.
.sp
Reloaded on reload signal\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBallow_duplicate_messages\fR [ true | false ]
.RS 4
If a client is subscribed to multiple subscriptions that overlap, e\&.g\&. foo/# and foo/+/baz , then MQTT expects that when the broker receives a message on a topic that matches both subscriptions, such as foo/bar/baz, then the client should only receive the message once\&.
.sp
Mosquitto keeps track of which clients a message has been sent to in order to meet this requirement\&. This option allows this behaviour to be disabled, which may be useful if you have a large number of clients subscribed to the same set of topics and want to minimise memory usage\&.
.sp
It can be safely set to
\fItrue\fR
if you know in advance that your clients will never have overlapping subscriptions, otherwise your clients must be able to correctly deal with duplicate messages even when then have QoS=2\&.
.sp
Defaults to
\fItrue\fR\&.
.sp
This option applies globally\&.
.sp
Reloaded on reload signal\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBallow_zero_length_clientid\fR [ true | false ]
.RS 4
MQTT 3\&.1\&.1 and MQTT 5 allow clients to connect with a zero length client id and have the broker generate a client id for them\&. Use this option to allow/disallow this behaviour\&. Defaults to true\&.
.sp
See also the
\fBauto_id_prefix\fR
option\&.
.sp
If
\fBper_listener_settings\fR
is
\fItrue\fR, this option applies to the current listener being configured only\&. If
\fBper_listener_settings\fR
is
\fIfalse\fR, this option applies to all listeners\&.
.sp
Reloaded on reload signal\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBauth_opt_*\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Options to be passed to the auth plugin\&. See the specific plugin instructions\&.
.sp
Applies to the current authentication plugin being configured\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBauth_plugin\fR \fIfile path\fR
.RS 4
Specify an external module to use for authentication and access control\&. This allows custom username/password and access control functions to be created\&.
.sp
Can be specified multiple times to load multiple plugins\&. The plugins will be processed in the order that they are specified\&.
.sp
If
\fBpassword_file\fR, or
\fBacl_file\fR
are used in the config file alongsize
\fBauth_plugin\fR, the plugin checks will run after the built in checks\&.
.sp
Not currently reloaded on reload signal\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBauth_plugin_deny_special_chars\fR [ true | false ]
.RS 4
If
\fItrue\fR
then before an ACL check is made, the username/client id of the client needing the check is searched for the presence of either a \*(Aq+\*(Aq or \*(Aq#\*(Aq character\&. If either of these characters is found in either the username or client id, then the ACL check is denied before it is sent to the plugin\&.
.sp
This check prevents the case where a malicious user could circumvent an ACL check by using one of these characters as their username or client id\&. This is the same issue as was reported with mosquitto itself as CVE\-2017\-7650\&.
.sp
If you are entirely sure that the plugin you are using is not vulnerable to this attack (i\&.e\&. if you never use usernames or client ids in topics) then you can disable this extra check and hence have all ACL checks delivered to your plugin by setting this option to
\fIfalse\fR\&.
.sp
Defaults to
\fItrue\fR\&.
.sp
Applies to the current authentication plugin being configured\&.
.sp
Not currently reloaded on reload signal\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBauto_id_prefix\fR \fIprefix\fR
.RS 4
If
\fBallow_zero_length_clientid\fR
is
\fItrue\fR, this option allows you to set a string that will be prefixed to the automatically generated client ids to aid visibility in logs\&. Defaults to
\fBauto\-\fR\&.
.sp
If
\fBper_listener_settings\fR
is
\fItrue\fR, this option applies to the current listener being configured only\&. If
\fBper_listener_settings\fR
is
\fIfalse\fR, this option applies to all listeners\&.
.sp
Reloaded on reload signal\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBautosave_interval\fR \fIseconds\fR
.RS 4
The number of seconds that mosquitto will wait between each time it saves the in\-memory database to disk\&. If set to 0, the in\-memory database will only be saved when mosquitto exits or when receiving the SIGUSR1 signal\&. Note that this setting only has an effect if persistence is enabled\&. Defaults to 1800 seconds (30 minutes)\&.
.sp
This option applies globally\&.
.sp
Reloaded on reload signal\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBautosave_on_changes\fR [ true | false ]
.RS 4
If
\fItrue\fR, mosquitto will count the number of subscription changes, retained messages received and queued messages and if the total exceeds
\fBautosave_interval\fR
then the in\-memory database will be saved to disk\&. If
\fIfalse\fR, mosquitto will save the in\-memory database to disk by treating
\fBautosave_interval\fR
as a time in seconds\&.
.sp
This option applies globally\&.
.sp
Reloaded on reload signal\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcheck_retain_source\fR [ true | false ]
.RS 4
This option affects the scenario when a client subscribes to a topic that has retained messages\&. It is possible that the client that published the retained message to the topic had access at the time they published, but that access has been subsequently removed\&. If
\fBcheck_retain_source\fR
is set to true, the default, the source of a retained message will be checked for access rights before it is republished\&. When set to false, no check will be made and the retained message will always be published\&.
.sp
This option applies globally, regardless of the
\fBper_listener_settings\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBclientid_prefixes\fR \fIprefix\fR
.RS 4
If defined, only clients that have a clientid with a prefix that matches clientid_prefixes will be allowed to connect to the broker\&. For example, setting "secure\-" here would mean a client "secure\-client" could connect but another with clientid "mqtt" couldn\*(Aqt\&. By default, all client ids are valid\&.
.sp
This option applies globally\&.
.sp
Reloaded on reload signal\&. Note that currently connected clients will be unaffected by any changes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection_messages\fR [ true | false ]
.RS 4
If set to
\fItrue\fR, the log will include entries when clients connect and disconnect\&. If set to
\fIfalse\fR, these entries will not appear\&.
.sp
This option applies globally\&.
.sp
Reloaded on reload signal\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBinclude_dir\fR \fIdir\fR
.RS 4
External configuration files may be included by using the include_dir option\&. This defines a directory that will be searched for config files\&. All files that end in \*(Aq\&.conf\*(Aq will be loaded as a configuration file\&. It is best to have this as the last option in the main file\&. This option will only be processed from the main configuration file\&. The directory specified must not contain the main configuration file\&.
.sp
The configuration files in
\fBinclude_dir\fR
are loaded in case sensitive alphabetical order, with the upper case of each letter ordered before the lower case of the same letter\&.
.PP
\fBExample\ \&Load Order for include_dir.\ \&\fR
Given the files
\fIb\&.conf\fR,
\fIA\&.conf\fR,
\fI01\&.conf\fR,
\fIa\&.conf\fR,
\fIB\&.conf\fR, and
\fI00\&.conf\fR
inside
\fBinclude_dir\fR, the config files would be loaded in this order:

.sp
\fBsyslog\fR
uses the userspace syslog facility which usually ends up in /var/log/messages or similar and topic logs to the broker topic \*(Aq$SYS/broker/log/<severity>\*(Aq, where severity is one of D, E, W, N, I, M which are debug, error, warning, notice, information and message\&. Message type severity is used by the subscribe and unsubscribe log_type options and publishes log messages at $SYS/broker/log/M/subscribe and $SYS/broker/log/M/unsubscribe\&.
.sp
The
\fBfile\fR
destination requires an additional parameter which is the file to be logged to, e\&.g\&. "log_dest file /var/log/mosquitto\&.log"\&. The file will be closed and reopened when the broker receives a HUP signal\&. Only a single file destination may be configured\&.
.sp
Use "log_dest none" if you wish to disable logging\&. Defaults to stderr\&. This option may be specified multiple times\&.

For MQTT v5 clients, it is possible to have the server send a "server keepalive" value that will override the keepalive value set by the client\&. This is intended to be used as a mechanism to say that the server will disconnect the client earlier than it anticipated, and that the client should use the new keepalive value\&. The max_keepalive option allows you to specify that clients may only connect with keepalive less than or equal to this value, otherwise they will be sent a server keepalive telling them to use max_keepalive\&.

\fBrestart_timeout\fR \fIbase cap\fR, \fBrestart_timeout\fR \fIconstant\fR
.RS 4
Set the amount of time a bridge using the automatic start type will wait until attempting to reconnect\&.
.sp
This option can be configured to use a constant delay time in seconds, or to use a backoff mechanism based on "Decorrelated Jitter", which adds a degree of randomness to when the restart occurs, starting at the base and increasing up to the cap\&. Set a constant timeout of 20 seconds:
.sp
.if n \{\

\fBround_robin\fR [ true | false ]
.RS 4
If the bridge has more than one address given in the address/addresses configuration, the round_robin option defines the behaviour of the bridge on a failure of the bridge connection\&. If round_robin is
\fIfalse\fR, the default value, then the first address is treated as the main bridge connection\&. If the connection fails, the other secondary addresses will be attempted in turn\&. Whilst connected to a secondary bridge, the bridge will periodically attempt to reconnect to the main bridge until successful\&.
.sp
If round_robin is
\fItrue\fR, then all addresses are treated as equals\&. If a connection fails, the next address will be tried and if successful will remain connected until it fails\&.
.RE

\fBstart_type\fR [ automatic | lazy | once ]
.RS 4
Set the start type of the bridge\&. This controls how the bridge starts and can be one of three types:
\fIautomatic\fR,
\fIlazy \fRand
\fIonce\fR\&. Note that RSMB provides a fourth start type "manual" which isn\*(Aqt currently supported by mosquitto\&.
.sp
\fIautomatic\fR
is the default start type and means that the bridge connection will be started automatically when the broker starts and also restarted after a short delay (30 seconds) if the connection fails\&.
.sp
Bridges using the
\fIlazy\fR
start type will be started automatically when the number of queued messages exceeds the number set with the
\fBthreshold\fR
option\&. It will be stopped automatically after the time set by the
\fBidle_timeout\fR
parameter\&. Use this start type if you wish the connection to only be active when it is needed\&.

A bridge using the
\fIonce\fR
start type will be started automatically when the broker starts but will not be restarted if the connection fails\&.
.RE

\fBtopic\fR \fIpattern\fR [[[ out | in | both ] qos\-level] local\-prefix remote\-prefix]
.RS 4
Define a topic pattern to be shared between the two brokers\&. Any topics matching the pattern (which may include wildcards) are shared\&. The second parameter defines the direction that the messages will be shared in, so it is possible to import messages from a remote broker using
\fIin\fR, export messages to a remote broker using
\fIout\fR
or share messages in both directions\&. If this parameter is not defined, the default of
\fIout\fR
is used\&. The QoS level defines the publish/subscribe QoS level used for this topic and defaults to 0\&.
.sp
The
\fIlocal\-prefix\fR
and
\fIremote\-prefix\fR
options allow topics to be remapped when publishing to and receiving from remote brokers\&. This allows a topic tree from the local broker to be inserted into the topic tree of the remote broker at an appropriate place\&.
.sp
For incoming topics, the bridge will prepend the pattern with the remote prefix and subscribe to the resulting topic on the remote broker\&. When a matching incoming message is received, the remote prefix will be removed from the topic and then the local prefix added\&.
.sp
For outgoing topics, the bridge will prepend the pattern with the local prefix and subscribe to the resulting topic on the local broker\&. When an outgoing message is processed, the local prefix will be removed from the topic then the remote prefix added\&.
.sp
When using topic mapping, an empty prefix can be defined using the place marker
\fI""\fR\&. Using the empty marker for the topic itself is also valid\&. The table below defines what combination of empty or value is valid\&. The
\fBFull Local Topic\fR
and
\fBFull Remote Topic\fR
show the resulting topics that would be used on the local and remote ends of the bridge\&. For example, for the first table row if you publish to
\fBL/topic\fR
on the local broker, then the remote broker will receive a message on the topic
\fBR/topic\fR\&.
